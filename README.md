# LittleSorter

A little sorter that sort all files to folders by it extension.

## USAGE 
If you want to sort files without copy, you need to add (BETA FEATURE!!!)`-d`(WORKING UNSTABLE) CLI arg `flag`.

For example:

`cargo run -- <path/to/files> <flag>`

`<flag>` is optional, `<path/to/files>` required.


## NOTE:
if you use `-d` flag, folders will be deleted after sorting files(UNSTABLE. MAY NEED TO CALL SEVERAL TIMES). 
Keep it in mind.
